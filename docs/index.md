# Documentation for pynxtools-ellips

`pynxtools-ellips` is a free and open-source data software for harmonizing ellipsometry data and metadata for research data management using [NeXus](https://www.nexusformat.org/), implemented with the goal to make scientific research data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable).

`pynxtools-ellips`, which is a plugin for [pynxtools](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools), provides a tool for reading data from (currently Woollam VASE) proprietary and open data formats from technology partners and the wider ellipsometry community. The tool standardizes these data such that it is compliant with the NeXus application definitions [`NXoptical_spectroscopy`](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nexus_definitions/classes/applications/NXoptical_spectroscopy.html) and its extension [`NXellipsometry`](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nexus_definitions/classes/applications/NXellipsometry.html). `pynxtools-ellips` is developed both as a standalone reader and as a tool within [NOMAD](https://nomad-lab.eu/), which is the open-source data management platform for materials science we are developing with [FAIRmat](https://www.fairmat-nfdi.eu/fairmat/).

`pynxtools-ellips` solves the challenge of using heterogeneous and unfindable data formats which is common in the field of ellipsometry.

`pynxtools-ellips` is useful for scientists from the ellipsometry community that deal with heterogeneous data, for technology partners and data providers looking for ways to make their data FAIRer, and for research groups that want to organize their data using NeXus and NOMAD.
