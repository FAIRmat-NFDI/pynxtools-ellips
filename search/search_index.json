The tool standardizes these data such that it is compliant with the NeXus application definitions <code>NXoptical_spectroscopy</code> and its extension <code>NXellipsometry</code>. <code>pynxtools-ellips</code> is developed both as a standalone reader and as a tool within NOMAD, which is the open-source data management platform for materials science we are developing with FAIRmat.</p> <p><code>pynxtools-ellips</code> solves the challenge of using heterogeneous and unfindable data formats which is common in the field of ellipsometry.</p> <p><code>pynxtools-ellips</code> is useful for scientists from the ellipsometry community that deal with heterogeneous data, for technology partners and data providers looking for ways to make their data FAIRer, and for research groups that want to organize their data using NeXus and NOMAD.</p>  Contact  <p>For questions or suggestions:</p> <ul> <li>Open an issue on the <code>pynxtools-ellips</code> GitHub</li> <li>Join our Discord channel</li> <li>Get in contact with our lead developers.</li> </ul> Project and community <ul> <li>NOMAD code guidelines</li> </ul> <p>The work is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - 460197019 (FAIRmat).</p>"},{"location":"index.html#tutorial","title":"Tutorial","text":"<ul> <li>Installation guide</li> <li>Development guide</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#how-to-guides","title":"How-to guides","text":"<p>Coming soon!</p>"},{"location":"index.html#learn","title":"Learn","text":"<p>Coming soon!</p>"},{"location":"index.html#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<p>Here you can learn which specific measurement setups and file formats from technology partners <code>pynxtools-ellips</code> currently supports.</p> <ul> <li>Woollam VASE</li> </ul>"},{"location":"contact.html","title":"Get in contact","text":"<p>NOMAD, <code>pynxtools</code>, and <code>pynxtools-ellips</code> are open source projects that warmly welcome community projects, contributions, suggestions, bug fixes, and constructive feedback. <code>pynxtools</code> is built mainly within FAIRmat Area B - Experiment.</p> <p>You can reach us through different channels.
